//-->In java, both Errors and Exceptions are the subclasses of java.lang.Throwable class. Error refers to an illegal operation performed by the user which results in the abnormal working of the program. Programming errors often remain undetected until the program is compiled or executed. Some of the errors inhibit the program from getting compiled or executed. Thus errors should be removed before compiling and executing. It is of three types:
//
//      Syntax error
//      Logical   error
//      Run-time  error

public class Errors_Exceptions_78 {
    public static void main(String[] args){
//        int a =5               //Syntax error
//        System.out.println(a);\

        

    }
}
